## Sprint Demo, Tue Sept 26 2023:
<ul>
	<li>
		Fixed an issue with collapsing and expanding of the Details toggle in the Patient header
		<ul>
			<li>We were able to tab onto the field but doing so with the mouse was not working</li>
			<li>Now both of the 2 inputs are working</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Came up with a really cool script with David. This helps with our integration effort while closing out instances
		<ul>
			<li>It automates the process of generating audit reports for every single patient in our platform</li>
			<li>Automatically renames the filenames to patient_id.pdf or mrn.pdf, configurable by a parameter</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Researched a way to centralize the Lab Mapping/Unit conversions table within Rimidify. Proposals include:
		<ul>
			<li>No reverse dependency to provider while processing observations/lab data</li>
			<li>Benefits integration team by reducing effort on having to keep mappings consistant across instances</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
